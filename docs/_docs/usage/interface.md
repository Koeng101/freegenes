# Interface

FreeGenes has general functionality for non authenticated users to search,
and detail is provided after a user has created an account.

## Search

The main entrypoint for finding content is via search. A basic search (from the
home page or the search endpoint) will return a list of results:

![search-result.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/usage/search-result)

The results currently don't link to detail views (but will). The user will
need to be authenticated to see the details (or it could be they can
see some derivative).
