# Setup

You'll first need to clone the repository to your local machine, or where you
intend to deploy it.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/vsoch/freegenes
```

Ensure that you have both [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and 
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.
