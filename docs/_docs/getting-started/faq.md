## General

### What is freegenes?
FreeGenes is an intiative by the BioBricks Foundation to create an open technology commons. You can read more about it here.

### How is this different from the iGEM registry?
There are two major differences between the Free Genes Project and the iGEM registry: The scope of distribution and the distribution methodology. First, iGEM only distributes once a year to academics and non-profits, while Free Genes distributes continuously to anyone, including academics, non-profits, companies, and even DIYbio hackers. Second, Free Genes is also interested in increasing access to biological tools through alternative distribution methodologies, such as decentralized B. subtilis spore-based distribution sets, which may drastically lower costs in DNA production, distribution, and storage. Rather than being a purely central hub for DNA, we hope that in the future there will be nodes of decentralized distributors throughout the world.

## Inventory

### What restriction sites do you add/remove? (MoClo parts only)
We remove all common Type IIS restriction enzyme sites from coding sequences. These include AarI, BsmBI, BbsI, BtgZI, BsaI, BfuAI, and SapI. For other parts, such as promoters and terminators, we strongly recommend removing BsaI, BsmBI, and SapI if possible.

### Why do you remove restriction enzyme sites? (MoClo parts only)
In order to scale our cloning methods, we take advantage of GoldenGate assembly standardization, and in particular, the MoClo assembly method. We aim to make standardized open access libraries for every major organism in order to clone new synthetic DNA very quickly for any desired application. By doing this, we drastically lower costs and increase our assembly speed.

### What have you finished synthesizing?
We have completed synthesis of codon optimized versions of all the JCVI syn3.0 genes. If you are interested in any of those genes, please contact us.


## Regulatory

### What about third party patent rights?
We are currently developing an online tool to enable the community to quickly check DNA sequences for potential third party patent claims. Our goal is to empower the community to design sequences for synthesis that are free of third party rights and that can be widely shared. Stay tuned for developments on this front...

## Shipping

### Do you ship internationally?
We would like to support the international community, but will have to manage this on a case-by-case basis. Please contact us at koeng101@gmail.com for more information.
